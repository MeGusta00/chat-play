# chat-play

ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!

So, I wanted to tell you about this cool repoðŸ¤  called `chat-play`.

It's got a bunch of scripts in the `apps` folder that are super useful.

Plus, there are some awesome packages under the `packages` folder like `chatkit`, `monkit`, and `midkit`.

I know the README could be better, but anyway, just thought you might want to check it out! âš¡
